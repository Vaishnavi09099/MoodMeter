# Sentiment Analyzer 😊😞😐

My first AI project built from absolute zero! This program analyzes text and tells whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

⚠️ **Beginner Project Alert:** This is my first exposure to AI/ML. I'm learning by building!

## 🎯 What It Does
- Takes any text as input
- Analyzes the sentiment automatically
- Shows polarity score (-1 to +1)
- Shows subjectivity score (0 to 1)  
- Categorizes as Positive 😊, Negative 😞, or Neutral 😐

## 🧠 What I Learned

**Python Skills:**
- Loops, conditions, and functions
- Working with external libraries (pip install)
- User input handling
- String methods (`.strip()`, `.lower()`)
- Code organization

**AI Concepts (Beginner Level):**
- What sentiment analysis does
- Polarity: measuring positive/negative emotions
- Subjectivity: distinguishing facts from opinions
- How to use AI libraries without building from scratch
- **AI has limitations** - learned through testing

**Problem-Solving:**
- Step-by-step project building
- Debugging errors
- Testing with different inputs
- Understanding when AI fails
